# Vulnerability Management: Working Group Charter

## Mission

Provides discreet management of security vulnerabilities issues relevant for active CF projects.

## Goals

* Provides a single point of contact for security vulnerability reporting and management
* Provides management of security vulnerability reports through to resolution, including but not limited to triage, reporter and team coordination, embargo negotiation, CVSS scoring, CVE assignments, pre-disclosure and disclosure

## Scope

* Triage incoming security vulnerability reports to [security@cloudfoundry.org](mailto:security@cloudfoundry.org)
* Management of vulnerabilities through dedicated slack channels
* When appropriate, negotiating suitable embargo periods with the reporter to afford component teams time to fix the issue before it becomes known publicly
* When appropriate, assignment of CVE numbers to vulnerabilities/fixes
* Publication of pre-disclosures to allow all CF editions time to adopt fixes for high/critical vulnerabilities before they become known publicly
* Publication of disclosures

## Non-Goals

* Not adding security related features to Cloud Foundry
