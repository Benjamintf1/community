# How to Make Changes To Working Agreements

Date of Forum to be Discussed:
Author: Amelia Downs - @ameowlia

## Problem
We have formed a working group! Now what? We need to agree on how to work
together.

## Solution
1. Any approver or lead can write a new working agreement,
   like this one, as a PR.
1. The author will announce their proposal in the slack channel.
1. The author will present the proposal at the working group forum.
1. Anyone from the community can comment on the proposal.
1. All approvers + tech leads will have one vote to cast. They will cast their vote by
   replying to the PR with a "+1" or a "-1".
1. All approvers + tech leads will have one week to vote starting at the point when the
   proposal is discussed at the working group forum.
1. After one week the votes are counted and a simple majority wins. The tech
   lead will act as tie breaker.
1. If the votes are in favor of the proposal, then the PR will be merged. If the
   votes are not in favor, then the PR will be closed.
