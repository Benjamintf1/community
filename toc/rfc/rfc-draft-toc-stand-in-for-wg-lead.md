## Summary

Working Group leads are in charge of approving and merging PRs for their
Working Group. If they are absent, the TOC MAY make decisions in their stead.

## Problem

Sometimes Working Group leads go on vacation or get sick and are not available
to review PRs. This can cause progress on their teams to grind to halt until
the Working Group lead returns.

## Proposal

The TOC MAY make decisions for a Working Group lead in their absence. This
includes approving and merging PRs for their Working Group. All actions MUST
have the approval of a majority of the TOC members.
