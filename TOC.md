during the community feedback period at the end of each meeting.

## Election Process

### Candidate Eligibility

Current TOC members and
[Approvers](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/master/ROLES.md#approver)
with at least 3 months tenure are eligible to stand for election. Candidates may
self-nominate or be nominated by another eligible member. The approximate time
commitment of a TOC member is around 8 hours per week.

### Voter Eligibility

Anyone who has at least 50 contributions in the last 12 months is eligible to
vote in the TOC election. Contributions are defined as opening PRs, reviewing
and commenting on PRs, opening and commenting on issues, writing design docs,
commenting on design docs, helping people on slack, participating in working
groups, helping people on  and etc.

[This dashboard][1]
shows only GitHub based contributions and does not capture all the contributions
we value. _We expect this metric not to capture everyone who should be eligible
to vote._ If a community member has had significant contributions over the past
year but is not captured in the lfanalytics.io dashboard, they will be able
to submit an exception form to the steering committee who will then review and
determine whether this member should be marked as an exception.

All eligible voters will be captured at
`cloudfoundry/community/elections/$YEAR/voters.md` and the voters’ guide
will be captured at `cloudfoundry/community/elections/$YEAR/README.md`
similar to the kubernetes election process.

We are committed to an inclusive process and the TOC will have the right to
adjust future eligibility requirements based on community feedback.

### Election Method and Tools

Elections will be held using a time-limited
[Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) ranking on
[CIVS](http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/) using the
[Schulze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) method. The top
vote-getters will be elected to the open seats. This is the same process used by
the Kubernetes project.

### Election Administration

On behalf of the Cloud Foundry Foundation's Board of Directors, foundation staff will 
administer the election based on the process outlined above.
