This repository is a starting point for the community to use to evolve the technical community's governance. Recent changes in the structure of the ecosystem around the Cloud Foundry project provide an opportunity to revisit how the CFF's technical community operates and to revise the technical governance docs to build a healthier and more dynamic open governance environment for the projects.

Eventually, this repository will become the official home for the technical community's governance process.
