# Principles

The following are the principles that guide the development and evolution of the Cloud Foundry community's technical governance:

* Community decisions should be evaluated and made in a manner that is fully transparent to any member of the community (excluding security issue management), in order to ensure equal access to information about past decisions, current activities and future plans.
  * Example best practices: Architecture Decision Records, Publicly published road map (GH projects as an example of the example), Team meetings open to the community and recorded
* All project processes and the behavior of project participants should be structured to be inclusive and approachable for any willing and qualified participants, in order to foster a diverse community of users, contributors and committers.
  * Example best practices: Clear and documented path for contribution, Use of “Good first issue” tags to welcome new contributors, Clear documentation for users, Clear requirements for committer status
  * Diversity includes: Employer (or non-affiliation), geographic, cultural, gender identification, racial, education/knowledge, economic
* The Foundation’s rules for technical governance, as well as each PMC and project’s operating model, must be documented and published in a way that provides maximum clarity, in order to ensure that any interested party understands how and where decisions are made.
  * Example best practices: Development governance policies are written in plain language and published in an obvious location, PMCs and projects document their internal processes, Published listing of all topics/subjects mapped to relevant PMCs and projects
* Must address healthy community with limited code of conduct issues
* Sometimes not saying yes to every proposal is the right thing to do
