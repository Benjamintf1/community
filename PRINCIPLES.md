# Principles

The following are the principles that guide the development and evolution of the Cloud Foundry community's technical governance. The overarching goal is to get and keep a healthy CF community.

## Transparency
We want community decisions to be proposed, evaluated and made in a manner that is fully transparent to any member of the community. 
In particular, this means that all parts of the Cloud Foundry technical community (especially the TOC, working groups and sub-working groups) should aim for transparent communication and decision making (e.g. with Meeting Notes, Feature Proposals, Deprecation Plans, or Architecture Decision Records), publish their roadmap (as applicable and appropriate, e.g. as a GitHub Project),  and have/participate in public and recorded meetings.

This will ensure equal access to information about past decisions, current activities and future plans. The sole exception is security issue management. 

## Clarity
We want the community's rules (on all levels) to be documented and published in a way that provides easy and clear access.
In particular, this means that the community's structure and rules for technical governance, including any deviations or additions for working groups or sub-working groups are written in markdown and published (or linked to) in this repository.

This will ensure, that any interested party can understand how and where decisions are made and how to participate in the decision making or execution.

## Inclusivity
We want the community to be inclusive and approachable for any willing and qualified participants.
In particular, this means that there is a clear and documented path to contributions and participation.

This will ensure, that we foster a diverse community of users, contributors and committers.

---
Being transparent, clear and inclusive does not mean saying yes to every proposal, contribution or comment - saying no after careful considration of all relevant input can indeed be very important.
The rules have to be clear and non-discriminating and the careful consideration should be made in the open though.
