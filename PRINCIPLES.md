# Principles

The following are the principles that guide the development and evolution of the Cloud Foundry community's technical governance. The overarching goal is to get and keep a healthy CF community.

## Transparency
We want community decisions to be proposed, evaluated and made in a manner that is fully transparent to any member of the community. 
In particular, this means that any subgroups should document their decisions (e.g. with Architecture Decision Records), publish their roadmap (e.g. as GitHub project) and have public and recorded meetings.

This will ensure equal access to information about past decisions, current activities and future plans. The sole exception is, for obvious reasons, security issue management. 

## Clarity
We want the community's rules (on all levels) to be documented and published in a way that provides easy and clear access.
In particular, this means that the community's structure and rules for technical governance, including any deviations or additions for subgroups like PMC's and projects are written in markdown and published in this repository.

This will ensure, that any interested party can understand how and where decisions are made and how to participate in the decision making or execution.

## Inclusivity
We want the community to be inclusive and approachable for any willing and qualified participants.
In particular, this means that there is a clear and documented path to contributions and participation.

This will ensure, that we foster a diverse community of users, contributors and committers.

---
Being transparent, clear and inclusive does not mean saying yes to every proposal, contribution or comment - saying no after careful considration of all relevant input can indeed be very important.
The rules have to be clear and non-discriminating and the careful consideration should be made in the open though.
